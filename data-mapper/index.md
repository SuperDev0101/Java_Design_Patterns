## Intent
A layer of mappers that moves data between objects and a database while keeping them independent of each other and the mapper itself

![alt text](./etc/data-mapper.png "Data Mapper")

## Applicability
Use the Data Mapper in any of the following situations

* when you want to consolidate how the data layer is accessed
* when you want to avoid writing multiple data retrieval/persistence layers
